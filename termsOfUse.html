                    Title to any purchased items transfers from the respective Company selling
                    entity (i.e., Shein Haul Distribution Corporation if you are in the United States)

                    carrier outside of your country. Because our delivery of your purchased
                    item to the carrier shall constitute delivery to you, the risk of loss
                    or damage shall pass on to you at the time we deliver your purchased item
                    to the international carrier. Any claim you may have regarding damage to
                    the item during shipping or delivery should be made directly to the carrier.
                    Any claims against the Company for shortage or damage occurring prior to
                    our delivery of the item to the carrier must be made within five (5) days
                    after your receipt of the goods and must be accompanied by an original
                    transportation bill signed by the carrier noting that the carrier received
                    the goods from the Company in the condition claimed. To help protect buyers
                    from risk of loss due to lost or damaged goods, we generally offer a shipping
                    guarantee (insurance) on the Site for purchase.

                To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply
