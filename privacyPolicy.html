        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info"><strong>Effective Date: Aug 25, 2021</strong><br/></p>
        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info"><strong style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Introduction and Overview</strong></p>
        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">This Privacy Policy ( <strong>“Policy”</strong> ) explains how your personal information is collected,
           used, shared and processed when accessing this website or using other services provided
           by its operator, including any written, electronic, and oral communications, online or
           offline, and purchases performed (collectively, the <strong>“Services”</strong> ) as well as the rights
           and choices you have associated with that information.
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">The Services include any services provided via this website,
           located at us.SHEIN.com (the <strong>“Site”</strong> ), our mobile applications (the <strong>“Apps”</strong> ), our accounts and
           fan pages on social media platforms (the <strong>“Social Media Accounts”</strong> ), and any other websites,
           pages, features, or content owned and operated by the Company that hyperlink to this Policy.
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">
           The company selling the products via the Site and Apps and providing the Services
           (and therefore, the payment collection entity) is SHEIN Distribution Corporation,
           757 S. Alameda St., Suite 220, Los Angeles, CA 90021, acting as a joint controller
           of the information together with Roadget Business Pte. Ltd., 7 Temasek Boulevard,
           #12 07 Suntec Tower One, Singapore (038987). Therefore, the terms “Company”,
           “we”, “us” or “our” refer to different entities. 
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info"><strong>Please read our <a href="#" style="display: inline-block;">Terms and Conditions</a>
            and this Policy before accessing or using our Services. If you cannot agree with this
             Policy or the Terms and Conditions, please do not access or use our Services.
            </strong> By using our Services, you accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy on the
             site you are using.
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">The Company is operating the Services and the sale of SHEIN brand products, and therefore,
           is the controller of your personal data, and is also responsible for processing and protecting
           your personal data.
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">
            The joint controllers stated above have entered into a joint controller agreement,
            allocating the essential responsibilities as follows: Roadget Business Pte. Ltd.
            will be responsible for operating the Site and providing for its security.
            Shein Distribution Corporation will be responsible for using the Site in its
            respective territory to sell products to customers, collecting payment and
            processing returns. The joint controllership agreement is necessary because
            of the aforementioned separation of the technical and commercial levels,
            while at the same time processing your data is necessary for both companies,
            respectively, to provide you with the overall Services (consisting of both
            the sales and the Site and Apps).
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">
            <strong>Right to modify this Policy: We may change this Policy from time to time,
            to reflect how we are processing your data, and if we make changes, we will notify
            you by revising the effective date or last modified data at the top of this Policy.
            If we make significant changes that materially affect your privacy rights,
            we will provide advanced notice and make that clear on the SHEIN website or other SHEIN services,
            or by some other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before
            you continue to use the Services. Your continued access or use of our Services after receiving
            the notice of changes, constitutes your acknowledgement that you accept the updated Policy.
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="privacyPolicycontainer__info">
            <strong>Instant information:</strong> In addition, we may provide you with real time disclosures
            or additional information about the personal information handling practices of specific
            parts of our Services. Such notices may supplement this Policy or provide you with
            additional choices about how we process your personal information.

                    As explained in the “Overview”
                    section above, the provider of Services varies depending on your country
                    of residence when accessing and using the Services. The joint controllers
                    have entered into a joint controller agreement, allocating the essential
                    responsibilities as follows: Roadget Business Pte. Ltd. will be responsible
                    for operating the Site and providing for its security. Shein Distribution
                    Corporation will be responsible for using the Site in its respective territory
                    to sell products to customers, collecting payment and processing returns.
                    The joint controllership agreement is necessary because of the aforementioned
                    separation of the technical and commercial levels, while at the same time
                    processing your data is necessary for both companies to provide you with
                    the overall Services (consisting of both the sales and the Site and Apps).

                <div class="item-p privacyPolicycontainer__info">
                    Pursuant to the joint controller agreement, both parties are independently
                    responsible for ensuring the lawfulness of data processing operations and
                    for taking appropriate technical and organizational measures in this context.
                    This Privacy Policy is also jointly adopted by the joint controllers. In
                    the event of a data breach, the joint controllers are obligated to inform
                    and subsequently cooperate with each other in responding, with Shein Distribution
                    Corporation focusing on communication with the regulatory authorities and
                    individuals, while Roadget Business Pte. Ltd focuses primarily on our technical
                    response and future data breach prevention.

                    This Privacy Policy only applies to residents of the United States. If
                    you are a resident of another country, please see the applicable SHEIN
                    Privacy Policy and Terms of Use that is specific to your jurisdiction,
                    which is generally available on the local version of the App or Site. Please

                    Such countries may have data protection laws that are different in some

                    outside of the United States, you should immediately stop accessing or
